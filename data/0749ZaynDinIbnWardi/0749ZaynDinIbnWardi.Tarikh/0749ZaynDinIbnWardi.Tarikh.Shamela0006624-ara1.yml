90#VERS#COMMENT##: The automated headings were almost all incorrect and they seemed to be inserted whenever an em dash occurred. Very good correspondence to base text.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 3616, 3617, 3618
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I retagged the text trying to chronologically categorize the headers first based on the reign of the caliphs and then based on years. So, I added two first-level headers to show the beginning of the prophet’s life and the beginning of the reign of the Abbasids; and then I tagged all the years and obituaries, and then I levelled the headers. 2- After the period of Muqtafi (PageV02P039) there is no more header for the names of the caliphs. Some second-level and first-level headers must be added here by closely reading the text to show that the years mentioned are related to which caliph and to which caliphate. 3- There are a few fourth-level headers that appear before the third-level headers for years, and I tagged them with an asterisk (### |||| *). Maybe it’s better to move them inside the years so that we have a more consistent levelling for the headers. But I’m not sure about this. Someone must read the text closely to see if this makes sense or not. 4- I have tagged the obituaries. However, they do not necessarily appear after the events for years. In some cases, I see that after an obituary, the author returns to the rest of the events for that year without any header separating obituaries from the events. Such parts can also be separated by closely reading the text.
