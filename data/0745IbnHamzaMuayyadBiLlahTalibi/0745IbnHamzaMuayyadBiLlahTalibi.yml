    a death date of 749/1348 is also mentioned).
    Yaḥyā b. Ḥamza b. ʿAlī b. Ibrāhīm al-Ḥusaynī al-ʿAlawī al-Ṭālibī, 
    a versatile and prolific Yemeni scholar, was descended from ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib 
    and the imām ʿAlī al-Riḍā [q.vv.]. 
    He was born in Ṣanʿāʾ and played a role in politics, 
    for after the death of al-Mahdī Muḥammad b. al-Muṭahhar in 729/1329 
    he ruled over part of Yemen as Zaydī imām under the name al-Muʾayyad bi ’llāh 
    until his death."
