90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text has been digitised via Google OCR and due to the
    PDF's sub-optimal quality it was collated closely with the pdf by
    Gowaart. Some typos may remain however. I have taken some small
    liberties with the edition where I know it renders the manuscript
    incorrectly. I have also emmended punctuation somewhat to be more
    consistent with the rhyme scheme, as I am planning to use this for
    analysis. The editor generally followed this logic but was not always
    consistent. Some hierarchy has been introduced in the headers, but the
    text does not actually clearly signpost this and many of the headers are
    also editorial additions (differentiated by square brackets), so the
    hierarchy is largely based on a study of the contents.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Since the levelling of the headers presented by the
    annotator is “based on a study of the contents” and I didn’t read the text, I
    did not change anything. However, as far as I can understand from the headers,
    maybe some of them need to be changed. I would tag the headers in pages 93-117
    as first-level and would decrease the levelling in pages 118-134 by one, for
    example.
