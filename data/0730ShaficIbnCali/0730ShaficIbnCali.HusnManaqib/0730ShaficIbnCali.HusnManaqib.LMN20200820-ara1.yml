90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Lorenz Nigst, Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text digitised and cleaned up by Lorenz Nigst with
    eScriptorium. Further corrections and mARkdown annotation by Gowaart.
    First fifty pages have been corrected closely, the rest has only been
    annotated , so some typos doubtlessly remain. Text was digitised from
    the second edition of the work, which has a significantly larger typeset
    and thus runs for many more pages. The edition contains a number of
    additions made by the editor (taken from other Mamluk historians) to
    make up for lost folios in the manuscript. It should be noted that these
    additions are unlikely to represent the original state of this text, as
    HusnManaqib was not actually quoted by any later historians. These
    additions are marked by square brackets.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes.
