90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text has been digitised via Google OCR and due to the PDF's sub-optimal quality it was collated closely with the pdf by Gowaart. Some typos may remain however. I have taken some small liberties with the edition where I know it renders the manuscript incorrectly. I have also emmended punctuation somewhat to be more consistent with the rhyme scheme, as I am planning to use this for analysis. The editor generally followed this logic but was not always consistent. Some hierarchy has been introduced in the headers, but the text does not actually clearly signpost this and many of the headers are also editorial additions (differentiated by square brackets), so the hierarchy is largely based on a study of the contents.
