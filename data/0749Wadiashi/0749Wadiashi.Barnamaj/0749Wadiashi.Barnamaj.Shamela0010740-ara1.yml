90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: LMN
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The author's opening remarks indicate that the two parts form part of the original
  structure of the work; "[al-juzʾ al-awwal min barnāmaj Wādī Āshī]" has been added by the annotator in square brackets
  to make that clearer; 
  the underlying print edition is not consistent with regard to paragraphs; 
  the numbers preceding the individuals listed in the text were shifted by the annotator; this way, 
  each dictionary item includes terms such as muḥaddith, shaykh, zāhid (etc.), a number of which almost always
  precedes the name of the individual properly speaking.
