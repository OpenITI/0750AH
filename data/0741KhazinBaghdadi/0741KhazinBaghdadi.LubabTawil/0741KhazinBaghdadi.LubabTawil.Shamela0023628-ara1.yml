90#VERS#COMMENT##: The base and collated texts are both based upon the
        1st edition, although the former refers to a 1st edition published in
        1995, while I used an edition from 2004. The editions appear to be the
        same. The text conforms very closely to the printed edition. The scribe
        has added titles detailing the ayas under discussion, and I have kept
        these as sub-section headings. Unfortunately, the quranic quotations are
        no longer differentiated from the rest of the text by any markers.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
