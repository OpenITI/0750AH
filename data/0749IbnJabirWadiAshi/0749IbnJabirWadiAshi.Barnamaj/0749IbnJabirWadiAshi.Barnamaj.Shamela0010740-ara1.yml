90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: LMN
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The author's opening remarks indicate that the two
    parts form part of the original structure of the work; "[al-juzʾ al-
    awwal min barnāmaj Wādī Āshī]" has been added by the annotator in square
    brackets to make that clearer;  the underlying print edition is not
    consistent with regard to paragraphs;  the numbers preceding the
    individuals listed in the text were shifted by the annotator; this way,
    each dictionary item includes terms such as muḥaddith, shaykh, zāhid
    (etc.), a number of which almost always precedes the name of the
    individual properly speaking.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. Women’s biographies tagged. 2-
    The bibliographical entries in the second part of the text are the books the
    author has studied under the supervision of his teachers during his lifetime,
    and therefore gives information about the author and his teachers rather than
    the books themselves. So, I don’t think they should be tagged as bibliographical
    entries since they do not include much information about the books. However, I
    didn’t remove the tags in this part since I’m not sure if such entries should be
    tagged or not. 3- A different edition can be found here:
