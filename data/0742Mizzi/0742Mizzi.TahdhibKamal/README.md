Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Shamela was chosen, which seems to be as good as JK, concerning the number of marked entries. Schia has poor quality. PDF is close to all of them.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Link for PDF is in url-document.
Pagination is the same.


## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

some typos found - all concerning numbering

## 4. Add any comments on the text


- In the last volume there is a section with womens biographies -> كتاب النساء
- The cross references are now marked with ### $$ -> this might has to be changed into proper tagging.
- bab -> ### |
- machlid -> ### |
- groups of names -> ### || 
- ومن الأوهام: -> ### ||
- I layed the preferences on the biographies, thier tagging has a good quality now.
- I made few alterations with the headlines as well and they seem to be good as well, but I didn't check them all in detail.

Volumes I checked one by one - if the number of entries was +-2 entries correct, I declared it good.  

V 1: entries 1-133 complete (+-2)
V 2: entries 134-410 complete(+-2)
V 3: entries 411-634 complete (+-2)
V 4: entries 635-931 complete (+-2)
