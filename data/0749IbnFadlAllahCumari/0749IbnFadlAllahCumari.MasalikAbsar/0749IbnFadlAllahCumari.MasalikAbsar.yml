90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A 27-volume geographical work. 
    Sezgin describes it in his Geschichte der arabischen Schrifttums (15.291):
    "(al-ʿUmarī) constructed his book in two main parts: the first four volumes
    treat purely geographical problems, the remaining 23 volumes the 
    inhabitants of the Earth (sukkān al-arḍ). (...) Ibn Faḍl Allāh has preserved
    the world map and the first three clime maps of the Ma'mūn geography,
    in addition to significant citations from the descriptive part of that work.
