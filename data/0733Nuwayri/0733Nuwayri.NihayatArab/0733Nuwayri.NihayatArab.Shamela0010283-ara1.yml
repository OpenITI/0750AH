90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There are three links in the VERS#LINKS. I used
        the first one for collation. It is exactly the Shamela0010283 version
        that I have worked on. But this link leads you to a payment-based
        website and you must have an account to see the contents. So I provided
        the second link which seems to be an older version of the first one. Its
        table of contents is exactly the same. The only difference is that in
        some volumes, page numbers are a slightly different. The problem with
        this second link is that it just includes the first 18 volume; so you
        can’t use it for the next 15 volumes. That’s why I provided the third
        link which is a totally different edition, but still it is partly usable
        for arranging the table of contents. 2- The
        0733Nuwayri.NihayaArab.Sham30K0010283-ara1 version had a lot of
        annotations, but I didn’t use this version, since many of the tags are
        arbitrary. Moreover, this version includes a lot of redundant headers
        and characters. The footnotes are also entered into the text and the
        pages don’t have any paragraphs. All of these make this version unusable
        for annotating. 3- Edit pro supports headers up to the fifth level (i.e:
        ### ||||| which is in blue and after that the colors don’t change
        anymore) and my categorization is correct up to this level. But
        sometimes the text needs headers up to eighth level. Although the Edit
        pro does not support this, I tried to keep up categorizing after fifth
        level header. Nevertheless, there are definitely some mistakes in my
        categorization after fifth level. Accurate categorization after fifth
        level needs thorough reading of the whole text (and, believe me,
        sometimes it is not possible even after close reading! The book’s table
        of contents is by no means accurate in some volumes). 4- The quality of
        the Editpro text is very high. The only difference that I could find was
        2 missing pages (pages 43-45 in Vol 2) and one missing paragraph (first
        paragraph in PageV18P098).
