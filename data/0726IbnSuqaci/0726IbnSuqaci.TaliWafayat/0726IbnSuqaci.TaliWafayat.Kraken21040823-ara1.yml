90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken; arabPers-WithDiffTypefaces.mlmodel;
    partial post-correction by SPL; issues with order of lines of poetry. PAGES THAT
    REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RE-KEYING OR RE-OCR'ING OR RE-ASSEMBLING; 26, 32, 40, 54,
    65, 68, 70-72, 83-84
    HRH: Deleted page 78 which was duplicate. All the numbers of biographical
    entries were digitized wrongly. So, I added all the numbers and their tags
    manually up to page 91. After this page, the text is not corrected as noted by
    SPL in this page, and is in an unusable state. So, I stopped reviewing here. The
    rest of the review should be done after careful correction of the rest of the
    text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
