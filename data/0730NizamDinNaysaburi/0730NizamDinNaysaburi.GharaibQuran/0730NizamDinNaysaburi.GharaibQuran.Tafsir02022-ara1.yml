90#VERS#COMMENT##: Incomplete text: text scraped from altafsir.com (by
    Alicia González Martínez of the COBHUNI project, Hamburg University),
    which contains only the parts of the text that are Quran commentary (no
    introductions etc.). The texts also don't refer to a specific edition
    and pagination is not present. The advantage of these texts is that
    there is a clear indication of the Quran passages explained by the text.
