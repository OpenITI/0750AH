90#VERS#COMMENT##: Very good and close correspondence to printed edition.
    Scribe has added some additional, clarifying titles.
    No set way of referring to qāʿidas: of the few I checked,
    they were only described as qāʿidas once quoted
    (e.g. a hadith and a qur'an verse were described as
    'and this is a mighty qāʿida').
    Late in the text qāʿidas as follows, e.g., القاعدة الرابعة.
