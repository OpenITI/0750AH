90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Started annotating the structure of the text; 
    initiall, PV put every kitāb under first heading,
    faṣl under third heading, su'ila / ajāba under fourth heading.
    In vol. 1, the levels have already been manually adjusted.
    Sometimes differences between the titles in the digital text
    and the pdf of the edition. (E.g., PageV28P509)
    The digital text adds (some) of the section titles 
    (added by the editor) that appear only in the index of the volumes,
    not in the text itself. 
    These seem to be indicated in the JK text with `| 1 <section_title> 1`.
    I would put these between square brackets (`[ <section_title> ]`)
    Other special tags in the JK file: 
    * `! 8 <`: no clear relation to the hierarchical level of the heading
    Poetry is (not always consistently) indicated with percentage signs; 
    using regex to format it semi-automatically:
    * search: (?<!%)[ ~]+%(?: %)?((?: |\r?\n~~)+[^%]+)(?:%[\r\n~ ]+)+
    * replace: \n# \1 %~% \2
