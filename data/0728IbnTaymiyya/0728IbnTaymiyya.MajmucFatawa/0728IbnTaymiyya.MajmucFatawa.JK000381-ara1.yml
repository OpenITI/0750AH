90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: According to the metadata, the JK edition 
    is based on an edition published by Maktabat Ibn Taymiyya; 
    PV has not found this edition online, but an edition by the same editor
    (ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Qāsim) and the same pagination is available
    on Archive.org (Medina, 1425/2004). 
    Neither of these editions is in worldcat. 
    PV started annotating the structure of the text; 
    in a first pass, PV put 
    every kitāb under the first heading,
    every risāla under the second heading
    every faṣl under the third heading, 
    every su'ila / ajāba under the fourth heading.
    The hierarchy will have to be adjusted manually;
    In vol. 1, the levels have already been manually adjusted.
    Sometimes there are differences between the titles in the digital text
    and the pdf of the edition (E.g., PageV28P509);
    these may be due to the different editions, 
    but likely rather an artifact of the digitization.
    The digital text adds (some) of the section titles 
    (added by the editor) that appear only in the index of the volumes,
    not in the text itself. 
    These seem to be indicated in the JK text with `| 1 <section_title> 1`.
    I would put these between square brackets (`[ <section_title> ]`)
    Other special tags in the JK file: 
    * `! 8 <`: no clear relation to the hierarchical level of the heading
    * `2 <section_title> 2`
    Poetry is (not always consistently) indicated with percentage signs; 
    using regex to format it semi-automatically (done until vol. 12):
    * search: (?<!%)[ ~]+%(?: %)?((?: |\r?\n~~)+[^%]+)(?:%[\r\n~ ]+)+
    * replace: \n# \1 %~% \2
