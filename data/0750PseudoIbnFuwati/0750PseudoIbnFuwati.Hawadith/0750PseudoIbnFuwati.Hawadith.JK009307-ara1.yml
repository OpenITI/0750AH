90#VERS#COMMENT##: NB: The shamela edition is incomplete. The digital
    edition conforms very closely to the printed edition. I found one part
    of duplicated text from approx. line 847-858, which should be removed.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
