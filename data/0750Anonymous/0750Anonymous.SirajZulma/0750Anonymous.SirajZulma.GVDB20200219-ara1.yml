90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text has been typed up based on one known
    manuscript source  (in a composite manuscript held by al-Azhar
    (49091/Majamic 1003  -- same manuscript as the main version of
    0710IbnRifca.Nafais)  by Gowaart. The author of the text is not
    mentioned,  nor is the text known from other sources.  The death date of
    the author is no more than an educated guess.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All the tags for third-level and forth-level
    headers are definitely wrong as these are the few words at the beginning of the
    sentences and cannot be tagged. I think the annotator has tagged them because
    they signify the beginning of new subject matters. If so, they should be
    replaced by titles in square brackets added by the editor of the text. Since
    there is no PDF for this text and it’s a manuscript typed by the annotator, I
    did not change anything. A specialist should edit the text first and add the
    necessary titles in square brackets so that we can tag it. Therefore, I did not
    change the extension to mARkdown and just raised a ‘review finished’ issue for
    it to make the case clear (Besides, the levelling of the headers should be moved
    up by one level, and the first-level header which is just the title of the text
    should be transferred to the METADATA section).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
