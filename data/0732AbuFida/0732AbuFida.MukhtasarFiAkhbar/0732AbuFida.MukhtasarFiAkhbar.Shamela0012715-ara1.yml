90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Generally, closely matches printed edition.
        Occasionally spelling mistakes and variations in titles (e.g., in most
        of the text the word 'dhikr' is omitted from titles). Text on V1. pg 1-4
        varies from printed edition. Occasionally page endings are out by a few
        lines. Text differs on V4 pg. 22.
        Gowaart: text is not varying on V1 pg 1-4 but missing entirely. I have OCR'd
        this introduction with Google Drive, corrected it and added it to the text. I
        tagged poetry and deleted html tags.
        NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 27981, 28672
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
