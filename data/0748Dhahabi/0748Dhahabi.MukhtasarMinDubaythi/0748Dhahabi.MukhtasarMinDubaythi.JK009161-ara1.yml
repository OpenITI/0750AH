90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet.
    See, `README.md` for details.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): A few titles added in square brackets to show the
    beginning of name categories. Levelling of the headers corrected. Untagged
    headers tagged. The numbers of name entries checked through Peter’s script and
    corrected manually. Women’s biographies tagged. 2- -The text consists of five
    parts. This arrangement is for the original author. So, I tagged the end of each
    part as PARATEXT, not editorial. 3- The digital text is published as an appendix
    (volume 15) to Ḫaṭīb Baġdādī’s Tārīḫ Baġdād published by Dār al-Kutub al-
    ʿIlmiyyaŧ. I used a different edition for collation.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
