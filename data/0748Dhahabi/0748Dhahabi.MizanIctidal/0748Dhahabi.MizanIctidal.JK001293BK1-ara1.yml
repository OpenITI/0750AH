90#VERS#COMMENT##: First tagging by an unnamed contributor.
    HRH: Untagged biographies tagged. 
    Women’s biographies tagged. 
    A lot of untagged headers in volume 7 tagged. 
    A few minor changes in the levelling of the headers made. 
    A few blank headers added to show the change of alphabetical order of names. 
    Editorial sections tagged and removed. 
    2- The text seems to be typed very carelessly. 
    I checked the numbers of name entries through Peter’s script 
    and corrected a lot of wrong numbers. 
    Besides, these pages were duplicate and I removed them: 
    PageV08P066, PageV08P068, PageV08P092, 
    PageV08P184, PageV02P120, PageV02P133,  
    PageV03P301, PageV04P202, PageV05P251, 
    PageV05P406, PageV05P472, PageV06P462, PageV06P554. 
    3- Missing pages: PageV03P172, PageV05P006, PageV05P172, 
    PageV05P186, PageV05P420. 
    4- The eighth volume is a dhayl written by a different author, 
    and was separated: 0806IbnHusaynNajmDinCiraqi.DhaylMizan.JK001293BK2-ara1
    5- Another edition of the text is accessible here:
