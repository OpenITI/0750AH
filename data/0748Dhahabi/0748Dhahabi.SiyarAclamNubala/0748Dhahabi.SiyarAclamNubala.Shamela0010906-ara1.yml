90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet.
        See, `README.md` for details.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Levelling of the headers corrected. PARATEXT added.
        Editorial sections removed. Women’s biographies tagged. The numbers of name
        entries checked through Peter’s script and corrected manually (A few entry
        numbers are outside the normal numbering. However, this is the numbering style
        in the PDF, not a problem in the digital version. I showed them with an
        asterisk: ### $ *). 2- I collated the first three volumes again and tagged a lot
        of untagged headers. 3- The name section consists of 23 volumes and the numbers
        restart from 1 in each volume. The volumes are not part of the structure, and I
        removed their header tags. There is a PARATEXT section at the end of each volume
        that can be used as a marker for the beginning of volumes. 4- A part of
        PageV01P376 and PageV01P385 is missing.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
