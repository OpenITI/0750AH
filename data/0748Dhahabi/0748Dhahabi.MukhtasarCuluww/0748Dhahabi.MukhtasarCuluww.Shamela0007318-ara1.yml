90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet.
    See, `README.md` for details.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All the numbers, both for hadiths/khbars and for
    name entries, had been tagged as ### $. I removed the tags for the first type,
    and kept the ones for the second type (which contain information about people).
    Untagged headers tagged. Editorial sections removed. 2- The main problem with
    the text is that the notes of the editor are inside the text without any marker
    that make them separable. Unfortunately, the only way to separate such editorial
    notes is to do it manually by collating it with the PDF.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
