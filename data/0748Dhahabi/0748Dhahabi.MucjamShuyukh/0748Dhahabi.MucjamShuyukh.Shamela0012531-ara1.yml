    See, `README.md` for details.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Women’s biographies tagged. A few minor corrections in the levelling of the headers made. 2- Around 50 name entries were not tagged. since the entries are not numbered by the typist, the only way to locate them is to collate a lot of entries with the ones in the PDF, which is a very time-consuming process. I did it for 10 entries, but did not keep it up. So, there are still 40 untagged entries in the text. 3- PageV01P021-24 (the author’s introduction) is missing.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
