90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Jonas Köpsel (Leipzig)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet.
        See, `README.md` for details.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial sections tagged and removed. A lot of
        untagged headers and entries tagged. Women’s biographies tagged. The numbers of
        name entries checked and corrected through Peter’s script. 2- The annotator has
        tagged all unnumbered entries as cross-references. This is correct for most of
        them, but some of them are not cross-references. The only way to separate such
        entries is a close reading of the text. 3- Number 6495 appears after 6510, and
        numbers 6503- 6510 and 6847-6849 are missing; but these are problems in the PDF
        and not the digital version.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
