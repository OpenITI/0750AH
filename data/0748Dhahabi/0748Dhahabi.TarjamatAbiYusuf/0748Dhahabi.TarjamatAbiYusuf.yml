90#BOOK#COMMENT##: The editor's introduction (p. 7-8)
    states that al-Dhahabī mentions in the entry on Abu Yusuf
    in his Tadhkirat al-Ḥuffāẓ that he wrote a separate juz' 
    on Abu Yusuf and his companion al-Shaybani.
    He found these two biographies in
    a majmuʿa manuscript in a private library in Haydarabad
    (it is not stated explicitly whether these appeared in the majmuʿa
    manuscript consecutively). 
    It is possible that
    the pieces on Abu Yusuf and al-Shaybani were conceived as a unity by
    al-Dhahabi (as suggested by his remark in the Tadhkirat al-Ḥuffāẓ),
    but there is no mention of the piece on al-Shaybani
    at the end of the Abu Yusuf piece.
