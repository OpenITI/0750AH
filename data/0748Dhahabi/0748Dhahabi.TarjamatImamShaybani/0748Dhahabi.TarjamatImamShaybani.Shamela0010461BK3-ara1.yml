90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original edition contains three tarjamas
    (Abu Hanifa, Abu Yusuf, al-Shaybani). The editor's introduction (p. 7-8)
    states that al-Dhahabī mentions in the entry on Abu Hanifa
    in his Tadhkirat al-Ḥuffāẓ that he wrote a separate juz'
    on the manāqib of Abu Hanifa; and in the entry on Abu Yusuf,
    that he wrote a separate juz on Abu Yusuf and his companion al-Shaybani.
    He found the juz' on the manāqib of Abu Hanifa in the library
    of the Mufti of Haydarabad, and the biographies of the two others in
    a majmuʿa manuscript in another private library
    (it is not stated explicitly whether these appeared in the majmuʿa
    manuscript consecutively). He then decided to publish all three together.
    PV split the text into three pieces. It is possible that
    the pieces on Abu Yusuf and al-Shaybani were conceived as a unity by
    al-Dhahabi (as suggested by his remark in the Tadhkirat al-Ḥuffāẓ),
    but there is no mention of the piece on al-Shaybani
    at the end of the Abu Yusuf piece.
