90#VERS#COMMENT##: structural tagging; text contains three tarjamas, not just the one of Abu Hanifa; it is unclear where the material was taken from; perhaps from Tarikh al-Islam? The work/title might be an editorial invention?
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The introduction of the editor says that the text is original, not an editorial invention. The editor has found three missing short treatises on Abu Hanifa and two of his companions in two different libraries and has published them together. The text lacked editorial tags. I collated it with the PDF and tagged it. Maybe itâ€™s better to separate the three treatises. I raised an issue for this.
