90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text was pre-tagged, most of which seemed sensible.
    Required a good amount of cleaning up however, and as this text is
    important to my research I spent a lot of time on the annotation. I have
    changed some of the hierarchy, but the organisation is often unclear
    without thoroughly reading the contents, so some of my choices may be
    debatable. Basically I have opted to try to be as consistent as possible
    throughout the volumes, meaning that first level is for the individual
    volumes, second level mostly for the start of a caliph's or main ruler's
    rule, third level for years, fourth level for events within that year,
    and fifth level for those things that are given specific headers within
    that year (+ characteristics and facts in list form at the end of a
    ruler's reign).   Vol. 4 was problematic: it omits some parts and
    preserved part of the footnotes. I have deleted the footnotes manually.
    Poetry is largely missing on pp. 6, 17-19 (but fully present for the
    following pages in which the same poem continues). I have marked this in
    the text with first level headers PageV02P179 is an empty page in
    digital text, edition has a reproduction of an illustration from the
    manuscript.  Poetry was automatically tagged but some of the verses were
    badly formatted, especially in vol. 1, 8 and 9. I have corrected poetry
    verses to be on the same line, as well as tried to locate the hemistich
    splitter in a more sensible space (it was often messed up due to layout)
    but in many cases this would need to be checked more closely. Footnotes,
    footnote markers and manuscript page markers have been deleted. I have
    deleted editorial sections (introductions, indices and bibliographies)
    except the editorial section rendering marginal notes from the
    manuscripts at the end of vol. 2, and at the beginning of vol. 6, which
    I have marked as PARATEXT.
