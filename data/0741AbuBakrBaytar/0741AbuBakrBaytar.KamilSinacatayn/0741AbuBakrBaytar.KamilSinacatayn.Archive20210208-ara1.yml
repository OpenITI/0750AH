90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCR by archive.org, cleaned up and post-corrected by Gowaart.
    Several pages have symbols and manuscript reproductions which have not been
    OCR'd.
    They're highlighted by "..." Each maqala is followed by several pages of
    endnotes
    (for example pp. 181-186, pp. 223-226) which were deleted--hence the gaps in
    page numbers.
    Here and there words or lines were missing. I've added them where I spotted them
    but more may be missing.
